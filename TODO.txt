*** edit build.yml, include new configuration.

* Mac OS X universal binaries
Allowing compilation of universal binaries is actually easy, you
simply disable dependency tracking and allow all arch flags (ppc, i386, x86_64). 
However this increases the size of the compiled files by a great deal; libneurospaces
goes from 8 MB to 27 MB.  This should be available as an option via the 
installation scripts. Information on automake flags: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Options.html

* move
bin/signal_voltage_characteristics to the Experiment package.

* neurospaces_cron
collects the output of all tested packages, summarizes, emails the
summary, computes a SHA on the summary, puts a file with filename the
SHA and with content the summary in the filesystem.


* neurospaces_cron
produces output like:

* in neurospaces_cron
  #t maybe make @trash a list that read in from 
  #t a trash configuration file. 

  #t then the test specifications can add to the thrash file when the
  #t harness runs, and such that the html output can produce a list
  #t of generated output files.

* documentation publication
** current situation
*** neurospaces_docs
builds with --docs
*** neurospaces_website_prepare
builds with --website-upload or --website-prepare

** operations
*** --docs
makes docs: includes doxygen, html-upload-prepare (generates html of
automated use cases).

*** --website*
	   {
	    condition => $option_website_prepare,
	    operation => [ 'make', 'html-upload-prepare', ],
	   },
	   {
	    condition => $option_website_upload,
	    operation => [ 'make', 'html-upload', ],
	   },

* bin/neurospaces_*
globalize $packages variable.
** should have the possibility to come from the config in /etc/neurospaces.

* should come in the project management subproject
** release management utilities
test-dist, etc.

** test framework
although it would be handy to have the test utilities in each package
too.
*** tests/command_extractor

** perl
simply add all dependencies as tar files.
perhaps also Sesa ?

** website
currently in neurospaces subproject.
should go in a separate subproject, called 'website'.

** CNS2006 presentation
and others.

* instrumentor ?
is only used in the model container, so keep it there.
